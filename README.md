## Kalman_Filter
This repository presents the model of the "Kalman Filter", which I have implemented in Python.
Kalman Filter calculates the value of the object's current state (like velocity, position, temperature, etc.) based on the knowledge of the previous state and predicted state, which can be calculated using appropriate equations.
After we know these values, we calculate 'Kalman Gain', which decides how much weight we should give to the predicted and previous states based on the error.

## 1D - Model
In this model, we only calculate values in 1 dimension (like temperature, the car's velocity moving in a straight line, etc.).

## 2D - Model
In this model, we calculate values in 2 dimensions. (like aeroplanes' motion in 2D plane)
